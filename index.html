            <h2>A Glimpse Into My Journey</h2>
            <p>With 20 years under my belt as a welder, fabricator, and mechanical engineer, I’ve always been a hands-on problem solver who likes to get things done right. About four years ago, I stumbled across programming, and it just clicked with my way of thinking—logical, straightforward, and no-nonsense. That sparked something in me, so I decided to head back to uni and dive into coding.
                Since then, I’ve been getting stuck into everything from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to Python, Java, Node.js, and Git. I’m now learning React and really focusing on building up my full-stack skills. The end goal? To become a full-stack developer, hopefully in AI or data analytics—fields that really interest me.
                When I’m not coding, you’ll find me trading and investing, which taps into that same love for analysis and numbers. I’m also making my way through Codecademy to keep sharpening my skills and staying on top of things.</p>
